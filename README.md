A fun algorithmic challenge with prizes!

## Boggle ##

Boggle is a word game where you connect letters to create words. Whoever finds the most unique words in the time limit wins.

1. The board is 4x4 in size
2. Letters must be adjacent to each other
3. You cannot reuse the same position twice
4. The word must be at least 4 letters long and in the dictionary

## Setup ##

1. You need a dictionary (e.g. https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english, https://github.com/dolph/dictionary, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
2. You need to decide on board size (4x4 by default, but what not 5x5?)
3. You need to decide on minimum word length (3 by default, but maybe more?)

## Challenge 1: Solving Boggle ##

Making a boggle solver is a little complicated because you have to try many paths on the board and keep checking them against a dictionary. You can do it in your mind easily enough, but writing the algorithm takes a little work. Whoever writes the fastest algorithm wins Challenge 1.

## Challenge 2: Solving Maximum Words ##

Find the Boggle board with the most words. That is, what combination of 4x4 letters (or whatever) has the most words embedded in it? Whoever writes the algorithm that finds the most words wins Challenge 2.

## Prizes ##

Yes, there will be prizes.

## Notes ##

The word list, board dimensions, and minimum word length are not specified ahead of time.

Challenge 1 takes place before Challenge 2, so everyone can use the fastest algorithm in Challenge 1 for Challenge 2.
